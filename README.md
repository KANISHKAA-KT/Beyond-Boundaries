# Beyond Boundaries Travel Agency Website - Login Page

## Description
This is the initial phase of the "Beyond Boundaries" Travel Agency Website. Currently, I am working on the **Login Page**, where users can log in to their accounts to access various features such as booking trips, exploring destinations, and managing bookings.

This project is built with basic **HTML** and **CSS** for the structure and styling of the login form.

## Features
- **Login Form**: A simple form for users to enter their credentials (username and password).
- **Basic Styling**: Clean and simple design with CSS for styling the login form.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: To structure the login form.
- **CSS3**: For styling and layout of the login page.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/beyond-boundaries-travel.git
